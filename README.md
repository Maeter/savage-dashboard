## Savage Dashboard
Savage Dashboard is ment to be a full-fledged interactive Game Master Screen for playing the [Savage Worlds](https://www.peginc.com/product-category/savage-worlds/) role-playing game. It will gather several tools/modules in one place to make the life of the Game Master easier.

### Current Tools
- Dice roller<br>
  This tool alows the user to roll any of the dice used in the system, from a d4 to a d12. By selecting the `Wild Card` checkbox, the roll is added a wild die as per the [core rules](https://www.peginc.com/store/savage-worlds-deluxe-explorers-edition/) and keeping the highest result, taking into account accumulated aces and displaying if a 1 has been rolled on the main die for possible `backlash effects`. 
- Perception/Notice checker<br>
  You can add here all your player characters with their `Notice` attribute to silently roll for them for perception purposes.
- Rules searcher<br>
  Allows teh user to find fragments of the rules by typing in certain keywords that match with specific parts of the Savage Worlds books. Currently it matches almost anything that it's highlighted somehow in the book, i.e: titles or bold texts. Currently only the [core rulebook](https://www.peginc.com/store/savage-worlds-deluxe-explorers-edition/) and the [50 Fathoms](https://www.peginc.com/product-category/50fathoms/) setting book are partially suported.

### Planned developments
- Improve designs overall
- Roll directly on tables, such as wounds, fear or loot tables.
- Roll dice for monsters/characters found directly in the rules search tool.
- Progress handler for mass battles
- Migration to standalone desktop app
